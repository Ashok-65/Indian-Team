Note: Not the same Images provided in the folder are used in the project, but also URLs

This project is a simple, one-page website that showcases Team India’s cricket players. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The website features a player card grid that displays each player’s name, role, and photo. When a user clicks on a card, a modal 
appears with more detailed stats like strike rate, jersey number, matches played, and best performance. I also added some animations 
to make the interface more interactive and smooth. The layout is responsive, and all the code is neatly organised by separating the 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into individual files. This project was a great opportunity to practice DOM manipulation, styling, and event handling. 
It’s perfect for anyone looking to build a clean and functional UI using core web technologies.
